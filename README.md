## Machine Learning Sensor Fault Project

# Problem Statement :
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of semiconductor wafers as either "Good" or "Bad" based on sensor readings collected during the fabrication process.

# Details:
Inputs (Features): The dataset consists of 590 sensor readings (Sensor-1, Sensor-2, ..., Sensor-590) for each wafer. These readings capture various environmental and process parameters during the wafer's
fabrication.

# Output (Target):
The target variable is labeled as "Good/Bad," where 1 indicates a "Good" wafer, and -1 indicates a "Bad" wafer.

# Goal:
The goal is t o build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a wafer is good o r bad based on the sensor readings. This prediction can help in early detection of defective wafers, improving yield and reducing waste in t h e semiconductor manufacturing process.

# Machine Learning Task:
Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)
Model Type: Binary Classification Model
